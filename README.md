# Bauer_Aron_Course_Project_CIS-18A


Project description: This is my course project for my CIS-18A Java programming class.
Purpose: Practice calculating area for basic 2-D shapes, and calculating surface area 
	 or volume for basic 3-D shapes
Creator: Aron Bauer
Version: 1
Date: 2\7\19
Usage Instructions: If you wish to test run this program yourself, recommend use cmd-line with JDK-11 
		    installed. DO NOT attempt to compile the original source code ".java" file.  For   
		    this program to properly run, in whatever directory that you will store the source 
		    code on your computer, put the entire "shapes" package hirearchy into a sub
		    directory named "shapes".  Each shape class must be put in its own seperate ".java" 
		    file in this directory IE: the "Shape" interface 
		    will need to be put in its own ".java" file as will the 
		    "TwoDShape" and "ThreeDShape" abstract classes and all their 
		    inherited shape classes will each need to be put into their own seperate ".java" 
		    file within the "shapes" sub-directory.  All those files may also 
		    need to be manually compiled using the cmd-line.  Lastly in the directory
		    directly above "shapes", put the other three classes: "MenuSkeleton" (interface), 
		    "Menu", and "GeoShapes" in their own seperate ".java" files.  If you 
		    compile "GeoShapes.java" via the cmd line (if your using JDK-11) it 
		    should automatically compile the other two classes.  
		    	Alternatively, if you are familar and proficient wih BlueJ or another compiler,
		    you may be able to test this program there as well.
